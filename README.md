## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/feedback-system.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd feedback-system
```

3. Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../feedbackSystem
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To run the Feedback System website, you'll need to have MongoDB running in the background.

1. Open a terminal and start the MongoDB server:

```
mongod
```

2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```
cd /path/to/feedback-system/frontend
```

3. Run the frontend development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `feedbackSystem` directory:

```
cd /path/to/feedback-system/feedbackSystem
```

5. Run the backend server:

```
npm run dev
```

Both the frontend and backend servers should now be running, and the Feedback System website should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, users can visit the website in their browser to submit feedback. They can enter their name, email, and leave their feedback in the provided form. The data will be stored in the MongoDB database.
